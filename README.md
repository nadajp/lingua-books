This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To store product images in aws s3 bucket, create the bucket and a user with read/write access to it, then add s3Client.js to the libs folder with the following content:

import { S3Client } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";

const REGION = "us-east-1"; 
const ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
const SECRET_ACCESS_KEY =  'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'

const s3Client = new S3Client({
  region: REGION,
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: ACCESS_KEY_ID,
    secretAccessKey: SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  },
});

export default s3Client;

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
